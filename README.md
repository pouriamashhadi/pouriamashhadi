## About Me:
 I am a programmer and graphic designer, but I am interested in the field of website design and I enjoy turning problems into simple, beautiful and visual designs.
<br> During these years, in the field of advertising, very good experiences were obtained in various fields such as logo design, visual identity and printing services, user design and other graphic related matters.
<br> I started working in the field of printing and advertising, and along with it, I was drawn to programming out of interest, and I started a close friendship with #C from the very beginning: ).
<br> With my experience and skills, I am able to progress and work as a programmer in the field of web design and development and now I am currently in the technologies that I can create the best experience in my projects.
